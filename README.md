[Deepstream](http://deepstream.io) storage connector for [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/)

This connector uses [the npm rethinkdb package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rethinkdb). Please have a look there for detailed options.

**Warning**: This plugin will automatically create a table, if it doesn't exist yet. But be aware, in case you create a table manually, use "ds_id" as the primary key. Otherwise the plugin won't be able to find your records.

## Configuration Options

```yaml
plugins:
  storage:
    name: rethinkdb
    options:
      host: ${RETHINKDB_HOST}
      port: ${RETHINKDB_PORT}
      database: 'someDb'
      defaultTable: 'someTable'
      splitChar: '/'
      reconnectTimeout: 2000
      reconnectCount: 0
```

```javascript
{
  //The host that RethinkDb is listening on
  host: 'localhost',

  //The port that RethinkDb is listening on
  port: 28015,

  //(Optional) Authentication key for RethinkDb
  authKey: 'someString',

  //(Optional, defaults to 'deepstream')
  database: 'someDb',

  //(Optional, defaults to 'deepstream_records')
  defaultTable: 'someTable',

  /* (Optional) A character that's used as part of the
  * record names to split it into a tabel and an id part, e.g.
  *
  * books/dream-of-the-red-chamber
  *
  * would create a table called 'books' and store the record under the name
  * 'dream-of-the-red-chamber'
  */
  splitChar: '/',

  // (Optional, defaults to 0) If the rhe rethinkdb connection is lost, try to reconnect max. this number of times
  reconnectCount: 2,

  // (Optional, defaults to 2000) Timeout between reconnect attempts in milliseconds. It cannot be less than 1000, if you specify less than 1000, then it will be set to 1000!
  reconnectTimeout: 3000
}
```

## Basic Setup

```javascript
var Deepstream = require('deepstream.io'),
  RethinkDBStorageConnector = require('deepstream.io-storage-rethinkdb'),
  server = new Deepstream();

server.set(
  'storage',
  new RethinkDBStorageConnector({
    port: 5672,
    host: 'localhost'
  })
);

server.start();
```
